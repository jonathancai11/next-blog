Hey, I'm Jonathan!

Just writing about anything that interests me. I'd like to call this a blog because that's all the rave, but it's really more like a journal.

If I eventually find a niche, then I'll tailor this content much more. But for now, it'll look like random rambling.

I'm from California, I study computer science at Rice University in Houston, graduating in 2021.
